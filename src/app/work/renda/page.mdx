## Overview

Envisioning your dream bathroom, you scroll through Pinterest, TikTok and Google to find inspiration. After sifting through hundreds of images that just don't quite match your vision, you finally discover the perfect bathroom design. Only problem- where do you even start looking for the products that bring it life? With countless brands, styles, and price points, the search can quickly become overwhelming. That's why Renda AI has partnered with us to develop an intelligent solution that generates realistic renderings with real products, helping you visualize your dream interior and have instant access to the items that make it a reality.

We developed the Renda AI platform, integrating generative AI with real product data that transforms a prompt into stunning, realistic interior visualisations complete with ready-to-shop product baskets. In just seconds, users can watch one simple prompt transform into a collection of curated interiors that you won't even believe aren't real. Try it yourself at renda.app.
