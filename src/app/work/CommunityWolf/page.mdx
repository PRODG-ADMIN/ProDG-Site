## Overview

South Africa has one of the world's highest crime rates, with thousands of these incidents being left unreported. This is where Community Wolf comes in- an AI-powered WhatsApp chat interface that encourages reporting and keeps communities informed with local crime alerts. The founders of Community Wolf saw the product's potential in empowering the underserved security industry, where firms rely on WhatsApp to coordinate across hundreds of group chats and messages. Seeing an opportunity to solve this challenge, they approached us to partner on Enterprise Wolf: a suite of WhatsApp and AI-driven solutions tailored for security firms.

Working together with the startup, we have deployed the first stage of the enterprise solutions– group agents that listen into WhatsApp group conversations to record crime, staff management reports, alarm activations and other incidents in real-time. The agents extract the relevant data and trigger several upstream pipelines such as alerting citizens and notifying local security firms to streamline incident response. As we continue to refine and expand Enterprise Wolf, our goal is to transform how security firms operate by leveraging AI and WhatsApp to create a smarter, more responsive network that improves safety and efficiency across communities.
