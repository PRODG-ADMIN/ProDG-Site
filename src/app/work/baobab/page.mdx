## Overview

The art of connecting promising founders with the right supporters has traditionally meant navigating complex spreadsheets and spending countless hours reviewing applications. This inefficient process creates bottlenecks in the entrepreneurial ecosystem, particularly in emerging markets where access to capital and mentorship is already limited. Baobab's mission is to bridge this gap by creating a streamlined application management platform that transforms how organizations discover and nurture entrepreneurial talent.

By partnering with ProDG Studio, Baobab has created an intuitive platform that enables supporters to efficiently review, sort, and manage applicants while providing founders with a seamless application experience. The platform has already facilitated connections for over 500 founders across 5 African countries, resulting in more than $25 million in investments and support.
